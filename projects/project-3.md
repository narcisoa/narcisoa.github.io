<a href="https://www.accessurf.org/">AccesSurf Hawaii</a> is a non-profit that empowers people with disabilities through accessible water programs. Last summer, I worked as an intern and this summer, I worked as the Administrator of the organization. I had the honor of working in a small, tight-knit office alongside the program coordinator, executive director and hundreds of dedicated volunteers who donate their time to our cause and care a lot about the success of our programs and helping others.



As the Administrator, I was responsible for planning and organizing the logistics which included leading 150-300 volunteers throughout the set up, running and tear down at each of AccesSurf’s events. I served as the central point of communication and connect people to resources and information. At the office, I worked with two AccesSurf intern/volunteers to lead and manage their projects such as developing the <a href="https://shop.accessurf.org/">online store</a>. I also introducted new technologies into AccesSurf to increase the efficiency of tracking information and collaborating with others. Specifically, I integrated data sets containing over 6000 entries using R and Excel to streamline input formatting and uploaded the data to the Bloomerang data management software. I later developed a work flow to track all of AccesSurf’s donations, volunteer hours, and participant information. I also implemented systems such as the project management tool, Asana, to streamline office collaboration and maximize the efficiency of tracking and posting on social media.

At AccesSurf, I learned the value of kindness, patience and gratitude. I found my love for community, talking to people and social good that will undoubtably stick with me for years to come. As the Administrator, I developed my leadership skills and how to work in a team.
